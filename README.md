# preppin-data

Repository for data cleaning practice following challenges provided on [Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/).

Although technically made for Tableau Prep users, I've been using python to finish the challenges.

It's a weekly challenge, but I've only been doing it here and there, whenever I had some spare time. The first few ones look a bit ugly, but I'm working on making the code even neater and improve readability. 

Learning in progress ...
